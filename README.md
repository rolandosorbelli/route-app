# React Routes App

This web app has been created using `create-react-app` command of React library. I built this simple web app so I could understand better how `Routes` work in React.

I simply started with an index page where I created 3 different links using `ul` and `li` tags. Every link goes to a different page using a different route which is a child of the main root.

I also created a 404 page with all the other possible routes a part from the ones that I declared, using `*`.

## How to start

After you forked this repo run npm start on your terminal and the app will be executed in your http://localhost:3000 on your browser.
